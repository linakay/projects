# Given a PGM file, output a higher contrast PGM with grey level histograms using only
# standard, built-in functionality (without numpy, matplotlib, or external libraries).
# I chose histogram equalization, which transforms pixel intensity values by
# normalizing the cumulative distribution function of the original image. The new
# image will contain more gray values at the dark and light ends of the spectrum.
# Type 'python3 thisfile.py /path/filename.pgm' at the terminal or change the
# pgm variable on ln 59 to '/path/filename.pgm' in a Python console to test.
